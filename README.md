tic_tac_toe-contract
====================

## Purpose

The goal is to write clean code that can be an initial guideline to develop using eosio.cdt.

This is a modified version of the following contract.
> https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/tree/master/contracts/tic_tac_toe

I converted the existing tic_tac_toe contract from eosio with reference to the following document.
> https://eosio.github.io/eosio.cdt/1.5.0/guides/upgrading-from-1.2-to-1.3.html

This contract will be updated continuously to migrate from eosio.cdt 1.5 to 1.6.
